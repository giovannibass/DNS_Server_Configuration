# What is this?
This repository serves as a collection of all my personal projects. The primary focus is on simplifying Linux administration tasks such as [DNS Server Configuration](dns_server_configuration), creating a NFS, and more.

Each project has a tool(s) as well as an in-depth explanation on the topic itself making it accessible to beginners looking to practice in a home-lab along with admins looking for a refresher.
